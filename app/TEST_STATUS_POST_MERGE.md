# Test Status After Merge

## Summary
After merging changes, all test files have been preserved and updated to match the new API changes. The core testing infrastructure remains intact.

## Tests Recovered and Updated

### 1. prismastore.test.ts ✅
- **Status**: All tests present, mock setup fixed
- **Changes Made**:
  - Added missing mock properties: `scan.count`, `scan.findFirst`, `image.update`, `experiment.update`, `plantAccessionMappings.findFirst`
  - Updated `getScans` tests to use new paginated API (page, pageSize, showTodayOnly)
  - Fixed `createExperiment` test to include accession_id parameter
  - Updated `getImagesToUpload` test for new include structure
  - Removed test for non-existent `getWaveNumbers` method

### 2. scanner.test.ts ✅  
- **Status**: All tests present
- **Issues**: Some tests failing due to method name changes and validation logic

### 3. Component Tests ✅
- App.test.tsx - Present (simplified version)
- CaptureScan.test.tsx - Present (many tests skipped due to complexity)
- BrowseScans.test.tsx - Present
- Experiments.test.tsx - Present 
- Accessions.test.tsx - Present
- PlantQrCodeTextBox.test.tsx - Present and passing
- FieldInfo.test.tsx - Present but failing due to import issues

### 4. Utility Tests ✅
- local-storage.test.ts - Present and passing (100% coverage)
- util.test.ts (main) - Present and passing (100% coverage)
- util.test.ts (renderer) - Present and passing (100% coverage)
- prisma.test.ts - Present and passing

## Current Test Status
- **Test Files**: 14 total (7 passing, 7 failing)
- **Tests**: 181 total (96 passing, 70 failing, 15 skipped)
- **Passing Rate**: 53% of tests passing

## Main Issues to Address

### 1. Import/Export Issues
- FieldInfo.test.tsx failing due to undefined component imports
- Need to verify all component imports match actual exports

### 2. Method Name Mismatches
- scanner.test.ts references `saveCurrentScan` but method may not exist
- Some validation logic in scanner may have changed

### 3. React Testing Library Issues
- "Should not already be working" errors in component tests
- Likely due to async state management or improper cleanup

### 4. Mock Setup
- Some component tests have incomplete mock setups for window.electron API
- Need to ensure all IPC methods are properly mocked

## Files Not Yet Tested (0% Coverage)
Still need tests for:
- main/main.ts
- main/preload.ts  
- main/electricstore.ts
- main/bloom.ts
- main/imageuploader.ts
- main/scanstore.ts
- main/streamer.ts
- main/menu.ts
- Many renderer components

## Next Steps
1. Fix failing tests one by one starting with simpler issues
2. Address React Testing Library async issues
3. Complete missing test coverage for untested files
4. Target: Return to 70%+ coverage, then push toward 100%

## Conclusion
The merge preserved all our testing work. The main task now is fixing the failing tests to match API changes and resolving environment setup issues. The testing infrastructure and strategy remain intact.
